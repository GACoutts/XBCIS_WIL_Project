- **Client**: client@test.com / Password123!  
- **Contractor**: contractor@test.com / Password123!

**Test Data**: 3 comprehensive tickets with quotes, approvals, and appointments

## 📋 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### **Immediate (for main endpoint fix)**

2. Test comprehensive endpoint fully
3. Add filtering capabilities (status, date ranges)

### **Short Term (next sprint)**
1. Frontend integration testing
2. Additional quote management features

## 💡 Key Architecture Decisions

**Smart Data Association**: Uses `tblLandlordApprovals` to link landlords to tickets (since no direct relationship exists in schema)

**Multi-Query Approach**: Primary query + enrichment queries for optimal performance and maintainability

**Security First**: Role-based access ensures landlords only see their own data
